# SymPyNet 
### A simulator for any level mechanism in the TCP/IP model.
===========================================================

Description of the project
--------------------------

SimPyNet is a composition of three words that characterise the project

1. Simulator
2. Python
3. Network

`simpynet` is a framework totally written in `Python`,it is able to simulate the mechanism at any level of the TCP/IP model in a network ( physical, link,network,transport,application).

The simulation is done by  the model DES (Discrete-Event-Simulation).
The simulator doesn't provide a GUI (such different simulator of networks as GNS3,OMNeT++).

`simpynet` provides a `logging` mechanism  and collectors that collects data during the execution of a simulation in order to realize `statistical`  analysis.

`simpynet` was born  as support theaching software for the course of Computer Network at university of Florence.
