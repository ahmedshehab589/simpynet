 SymPyNet a simulator supporting teaching of computer networks 

The name SimPyNet is a composizion of three words that characterise the project:
	- Simulator
	- Python
 	- Network
SimPyNet is a framework for the simulation of computer networks totally written in Python.
The simulation in SimPyNet is done by  DES ( Discrete-Event-Simulation) model simulation.
The simulator doesn't provide a GUI (such different simulator of networks as GNS3,OMNeT++).
Wwith it is possible to define small networks in all the intenet protocol suit ( physical, link,network,transport,application)
and experiment the execution with differetn values.
SimPyNet provides olso a mechanism of Log of the execution and Statistic analysis.
It born  as support theaching for the course of computer network in the bachelor degree of Computer Science at Florence University.
